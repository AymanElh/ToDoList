## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **PHP 8.0+**
- **MySQL 5.7+** or compatible database
- A local server like **XAMPP** or **Laragon**
- A web browser

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ToDoList.git
   cd ToDoList
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   - Create a new database called `todo_list`.
   - Import the `schema.sql` file from the `DataBase/` folder into your database.

3. Configure the database connection:
   - Open `DataBase/db.php`.
   - Update the database credentials if needed:
     ```php
     $db_sever = "localhost";
     $db_user = "root";
     $db_password = "your-password";
     $db_name = "todo_list";
     ```

4. Start your local server and navigate to the project folder:
   - Place the project in the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Start the server and open `http://localhost/todo-list-app/public/index.php` in your browser.
